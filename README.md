# Webpack-Basic Setup #
## Project intention ##
This project is a simple **Webpack** build project I'm starting out to learn about this module bundler, check out it's capabilities, personal fit for me and possibly it's suitability for some upcoming projects.

My past dev setups had me working well with task runners like **Grunt** and **Gulp** but now I'm looking for something a little more sophisticated, and hopefully something that will free me up to concentrate on design, UX, emerging technologies and less about task running to automate bundling, linting & getting things production-ready.

So here goes...

If you have any questions, advice, or if you're just interested in the project, please feel free to hit me up at [troyginbey@icloud.com](troyginbey@icloud.com).

That's it, for now.

## Hello, Webpack. ##
In their words:
><i>**Webpack** takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.</i>

The official documentation and information on Webpack is quite extensive, but has been found to be a little disjointed. Either way you can find it on their official site [here](https://webpack.github.io/ "Webpack").

Full disclosure: I've opted to check out **PluralSight**'s course,  [Webpack Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/webpack-fundamentals/table-of-contents) to kick start my learning.

### Project Technologies ###
I'll be using a standard base of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "Node.js") and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/ "npm") to set everything up.

As a front-end web developer I'll be exploring it's integration (if required) with technologies I use most:
- HTML5
- SASS
- jQuery
- JSHint
- Handlebars
- BrowserSync

In the process I will also be checking out the likes of **ECMAScript 6**, **Babel** and **CommonJS**.

I'm also very interested in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as a UI Library option, and trialling a bunch test of suites like **Mocha**, **QUnit**, **Jasmine** and **PhantomJS**.
